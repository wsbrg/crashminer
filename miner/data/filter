# For each task, we can supply a filter of specific crashes to focus on.
# For examples, with this filter every task, such as reproducing crashes,
# is only conducted for the crashes with the IDs
# 1278, 283, ...
# from the project 'file'. The IDs are assigned by and scraped from the
# OSS-Fuzz bugtracker. You may specify one project per line followed by
# a list of comma seperated IDs.
